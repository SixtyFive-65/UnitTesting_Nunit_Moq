Automated Testing -> Write code that tests our code in an automated fashion.

Benefits of Automated Testing :->Catch bugs before deploying
							   ->Refactor with confidence (changing the structure of code without changing functionality)
							   ->Focus more on quality

Different Types of Tests
		-> Unit Test (test a unit of application without its external dependencies (Db, Files, Queues or classes)) :Fast and easy to write
		-> Integration Test (tests the application with external dependencies (Db, Files, Queues or classes))
		->End to End Test (tests  through UI)  : Slow

		
							   
Favor unit tests over E2E
Cover unit test gaps with integration tests.
use end E2E tests for key functions of the application.
