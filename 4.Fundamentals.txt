***Characreristics of good unit tests

  -> Each test should have a single responsibility
  ->No logic (no conditional statements etc)
  -> Isolated, tests should not call each other
  ->not too specific/General
  
*What To Test -> Queries/ Commands

*What not to Test -> Langage features / 3rd party code

 
# Naming and organizing tests :->  Separate test projects (Blogz.Api -> should have Blogz.UnitTests)
							  :> should have a test class for every class (Comment, should have CommentTests)
							  :-> for each method in the Comment class we should have 1 or more test methods

Naming convention = [MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedBehavior]

**If there are too many test scenarios for a method, group them in their own class e.g CommentTests.IsUserAllowedToComment()
